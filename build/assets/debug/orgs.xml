<p>The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), with a half-century history of medical student activism, is the oldest and largest independent association of physicians-in-training in the United States.
Today, AMSA is a student-governed, national organization committed to representing the concerns of physicians-in-training. AMSA members are medical students, premedical students, interns, residents and practicing physicians. Founded in 1950, AMSA continues its commitment to improving medical training and the nation's health.
How is AMSA different from other organizations? When you join AMSA, you become part of a vital force of future physicians who believe that patients and health professionals are partners in the management of health care and that access to high-quality health care is a right and not a privilege. At AMSA, activism is a way of life. Student idealism is transformed into meaningful public service, innovation and institutional change.</p>

<p>G.I.V.E. was founded in the summer of 2008 at the University of Virginia. The idea originated from a group of college students who were discussing the lack of positive influences for teenagers living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. We decided the best way to take action was by creating an organization that was devoted to promoting college awareness in these neighborhoods. Our objective is to bring college students to underperforming high schools where they would give presentations and arrange local college visits for high schools students. In more recent events, we have evolved in doing fundraising for the Boys and Girls Club of Hicksville due to the fact that the state cut off their funding. We also plan to take part in their tutoring program, and even take part in some events from the organization, Big Brothers Big Sisters. We are also taking a part in the STEP Program, in which we talk to juniors and seniors in high school about the transition to college. We hope to inspire students to attend college and also work hard to graduate and create a bright future.</p>]]>

<p>The IEEE student chapter at NYIT Old Westbury has evolved into one of the most well-known clubs on campus in the past few years. They have been very successful in their VEX Robotics Competition as well as many other projects they are working on. This past year students have worked on robotics projects such as LEGO Mindstorms, Johhny 5, and the VEX Robotics competition. IEEE members have also created a Beowulf Computer Cluster, a collection of common computers that share resources to make a high performance parallel computing cluster. Another project that is going on this year is the construction of a hard surface touchscreen computer. Once complete it will appear to be a large box with a touchscreen on the top. The computer will run Windows 8 and IEEE members will be developing applications for the computer.</p><p> The projects that the IEEE work on throughout the year give engineering students a way to experience practical and interesting applications of engineering concepts that they would not learn until later in their education. By doing this the IEEE strives to increase retention among engineering students. The IEEE also does projects for Festival of Lights, Relay for Life, and other events on campus throughout the year.</p>]]>
